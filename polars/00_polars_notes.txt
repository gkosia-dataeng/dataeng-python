Its multi-threaded query engine is written in Rust
Pandas leverage numpy

Polars leverage rust and library arrow
Arrow is an inmemory representation of the data
PyArrow support micro level operations like multicore 

In polars there is no Index in dataframe
Polars does not have hierarchical columns (multi array columns)

Prefer to use expressions instead working on dataframe
With expressions we are on rust level and with dataframe on python lervel (more slow)

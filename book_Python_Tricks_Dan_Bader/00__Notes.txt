Abstract classes: ensure the derived classes implement particular methods
                  Cannot create instant of base class


Shallow vs deep copy: shallow (a=b) points to same values, copy.deepcopy create new instances

Class variables vs Instance variables:
    Class variables: belong to the class, not to the instance
                     all instances see the same variable (self.)

    Instance variable: belong to each instance
                       can accessed using the class name
